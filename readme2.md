## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of computer science. They form the foundation for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient code, optimizing performance, and solving complex computational problems.

This repository includes notes, explanations, and Java code examples for various data structures and algorithms. Additionally, it contains solutions to popular LeetCode problems to provide practical application and practice.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are one of the most basic data structures. They store elements in a contiguous block of memory, allowing for efficient indexing and iteration.

- **Properties**: Fixed size, homogeneous elements
- **Common Operations**: Access, Insertion, Deletion, Traversal
- **Use Cases**: Lookup tables, matrices

### Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

- **Types**: Singly linked list, Doubly linked list, Circular linked list
- **Common Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, Implementing stacks and queues

### Stacks

Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structures where elements are added and removed from the same end.

- **Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty
- **Use Cases**: Expression evaluation, Backtracking algorithms

### Queues

Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

- **Types**: Simple queue, Circular queue, Priority queue, Deque
- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, IsEmpty
- **Use Cases**: Order processing, Task scheduling

### Hash Tables

Hash tables store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.

- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search
- **Use Cases**: Implementing dictionaries, Caching, Indexing

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children.

- **Types**: Binary tree, Binary search tree, AVL tree, Red-black tree, B-trees
- **Common Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical data storage, File systems, Search operations

### Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can be directed or undirected.

- **Types**: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted
- **Common Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A* Search
- **Use Cases**: Social networks, Network routing, Dependency resolution

### Heaps

Heaps are a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

- **Types**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap
- **Common Operations**: Insert, Delete, Peek
- **Use Cases**: Priority queues, Heap sort, Scheduling

### Tries

Tries (prefix trees) are tree-like data structures used to store associative arrays where the keys are usually strings.

- **Operations**: Insert, Search, Delete
- **Use Cases**: Autocomplete, Spell checker, IP routing

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to reorder elements in a list according to a comparison operator.

- **Types**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort
- **Use Cases**: Organizing data, Search optimization

### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are used to retrieve information stored within data structures.

- **Types**: Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
- **Use Cases**: Database querying, Information retrieval

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

- **Common Problems**: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest common subsequence
- **Use Cases**: Optimization problems, Resource allocation

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

- **Common Problems**: Coin change, Activity selection, Huffman coding
- **Use Cases**: Optimization problems, Scheduling

### Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer algorithms divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine their solutions.

- **Common Problems**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search
- **Use Cases**: Recursive algorithms, Problem-solving

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a refinement of the brute force approach where the solution is incrementally built and abandoned if it is not valid.

- **Common Problems**: N-Queens, Sudoku, Subset sum
- **Use Cases**: Constraint satisfaction problems, Combinatorial problems
