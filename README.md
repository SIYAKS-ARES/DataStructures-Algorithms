## Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to your one-stop shop for all things Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering these fundamental building blocks of computer science.

### What are Data Structures?

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They define how data is laid out in memory and provide efficient access methods. Choosing the right data structure for a specific task significantly impacts the performance and scalability of your program.

Here are some common data structures you'll encounter:

* **Arrays:** A fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, accessed using an index. Great for random access but inflexible in size.
* **Linked Lists:** A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node. Offers dynamic resizing but slower random access compared to arrays.
* **Stacks:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the "top." Useful for implementing undo/redo functionality and function calls.
* **Queues:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure, where elements are added to the "back" and removed from the "front." Ideal for processing tasks in a sequential order.
* **Trees:** Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Binary search trees provide efficient searching and sorting, while heaps are excellent for priority queues.
* **Hash Tables:** Key-value pair collections that allow for fast access using a hash function. Perfect for storing and retrieving data by a unique identifier.
* **Graphs:** Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Used to model relationships between entities and solve various problems like finding shortest paths.

### What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions designed to solve a specific problem or perform a computation. They provide a clear and concise recipe for transforming input data into the desired output. Evaluating an algorithm's efficiency involves analyzing its time complexity (how long it takes to execute) and space complexity (how much memory it consumes) based on the input size.

Here are some fundamental algorithm categories:

* **Searching Algorithms:** Techniques for finding a specific element within a data structure. Examples include linear search, binary search, and hashing.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Methods for arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
* **Graph Algorithms:** Techniques for traversing, searching, and manipulating graphs. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths and Prim's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees.
* **Dynamic Programming:** Approach to solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results for reuse.
* **Greedy Algorithms:** Heuristic techniques that make locally optimal choices at each step with the aim of finding a globally optimal solution.
